How to make a file:
First letter needs to be capitalized, proper noun, then dot/period java, no spaces.

How to write code in a java file:
type this -----v
public class (file name)

To run code:
public class (file name){
    public static void main(string)[] args){}

}

; is the . for coding
every java needs a main method
int someInt = 89
int someint always has to be numbers
int someLong = 99999
just a way to say a longer number
String someString = "reeee"
just a way to say words and something thats not one letter

if you do // you can comment and it will not enter as a code
if you do /* you can see a type a lot of comment */ to stop the comment
everytime you write a java file you always need to do public class then the title of the flie { }
java codes need to be in a class
public static void main(String[] args){
}
this is the main method it is the start of the code so it will be first thing that starts

boolean aBool = true or false
just a way to do true or false statement
double someDouble = 0.4
just a decimal point if it has a . it needs double
char aChar = 'e'
just one letter never use this its old and useless but it comes up in old codes
a data can only be its own data type
int math = 2+4;
operation its just like math stuff like 9 + 10 = 21
math++; or math--;
to change the value ++ is adding a value and -- is getting rid of a value
everytime you want to make a new java file you need to put Filename.java
the first letter always needs to be capitalized
Filenames are like proper nouns they are always capitalized
